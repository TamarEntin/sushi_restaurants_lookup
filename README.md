# Sushi Restaurant Finder

This is a GIS project that aims to help users find sushi restaurants around their current location. The website, built using HTML, JavaScript and React, presents a map powered by the Google Maps API, with the default view being the user's current location.

## Map View

The map displays markers for sushi restaurants located in the area around the user's current location. As the user scrolls through the map, the markers for sushi restaurants near the current view will be updated.

## Restaurant Information

When a marker is clicked, more information about the restaurant is presented, including its ranking, address, contact information, and the number of reviews it has received. This information is retrieved from the Travel Advisor API.
